//Typescript
// open-source, superset of JS
// contains some additional features that do not exist in current version of JS
// strongly typed (JS is dynamically typed), can prevent a lot of bugs and makes app more predictable
// has some object-oriented features: interface, access modifiers, fields, propertie, generics etc
//we can catch errors at compile time (instead at run time), allows us to catch errors and fix them before deploying to prod

// declarind variables in JS  - data-type is not specified
// let firstName = 'John';
// let age = 28;
// let isMarried = false;

// declaring variables in TS with data-type
let firstName: string = 'John';
let age: number = 28;
let isMarried: boolean = false;
